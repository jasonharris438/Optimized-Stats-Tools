## Statistics tools with optimized code

### The projects are listed here -

   **stochastic_processes**<br>
   *Estimation and simulation of SDEs with numba optimization*<br><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At the moment only features a very specific implementation, but has<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a 2-d concurrent simulation technique that provides a speed up<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for multi-dimensional calculations.
